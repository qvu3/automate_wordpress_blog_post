# Wordfence Authentication Summary

## The Issue

Wordfence Login Security on your WordPress site adds multiple layers of protection that make automated API access challenging:

1. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Requires verification links/codes for login
2. **REST API Protection**: May block authenticated REST API requests even with valid cookies
3. **CAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA**: May require human verification that's difficult to automate

## Solution Implemented

The successful solution was to configure Wordfence to disable the additional verification requirements:

1. **Wordfence Configuration**: Disabled reCAPTCHA and email verification in Wordfence settings
2. **Direct Authentication**: Updated scripts to use direct login without verification steps
3. **Cookie-Based Authentication**: Maintained cookie storage for persistent authentication

With these changes, the script now successfully:

- Logs in to WordPress without requiring verification
- Posts content to WordPress via the REST API
- Maintains authentication between sessions using cookies

## Additional Features Implemented

During the troubleshooting process, we also developed:

1. **Verification Link Handling**: Scripts can handle email verification links if needed
2. **Manual Cookie Input**: Alternative method for cases where direct login isn't possible
3. **Enhanced Documentation**: Updated guides with Wordfence-specific instructions

## Recommended Maintenance

To ensure continued functionality:

1. **Keep Wordfence Settings**: Maintain the current Wordfence configuration that allows API access
2. **Regular Re-login**: Run `npm run login` every 14 days or when cookies expire
3. **IP Whitelisting**: Consider whitelisting your IP address in Wordfence for added security
